notes for hitbox and hit tracking
overlap, each attack is given an id number
id number counts up until x (maybe 64?), then loops
each hitbox will know its parents id
each enemy will remember which attack instances they got hit with (store the id number)
on overlap: check id number, if new, take hit and add to remembered ids. otherwise pass

gunstar heroes: look at it
bullet styles, mix and match
red and green combine to make something wildly different

arm shield
art style
assasinations, variety comes from how terrain forces you to interact with enemies and loadout variety
traversal is important

mmaybe move terrain up so you can tune combat around it?
most important part is limb swapping
EVERYTHING should be in service of limb swapping
