notes for hitbox and hit tracking
overlap, each attack is given an id number
id number counts up until x, then loops
each hitbox will know its parents id
each enemy will remember which attack instances they got hit with (store the id number)
on overlap: check id number, if new, take hit and add to remembered ids. otherwise pass
